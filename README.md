## About Me

I am Wagonda Francis Precious, an Information Technology student at Uganda Christian University. I completed my Uganda Certificate of Education at St. Joseph's Secondary School Naggalama in 2022 and my Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (U.A.C.E) from Seeta High School Mukono in 2024.

I am passionate about ethical hacking, software development, and artificial intelligence. I love solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into impactful software.

## Featured Projects
